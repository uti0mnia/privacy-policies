# Privacy Policy

Dota Sidekick and its developer take your privacy very seriously. Beyond the information Apple provides to developers that
you can decide to provide, Dota Sidekick also uses Firebase Services within the app 
([Firebase's Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy) can be found
here, note that Dota Sidekick only uses a small subset of Firebase's many services). This helps to identify crashes and 
stability issues (Crashlytics, Performance Monitoring) and why they're caused, which greatly speeds up and eases the 
ability to swiftly fix them. The information  collected is anonymous. Dota Sidekick does not sell or rent your data, 
and the anonymous information is only collected to help make 
the app better.
